Introducing HANGDOUT, a revolutionary way to play, collaborate, and learn alongside your peers! Upon entering the application, the user is greeted with a sign up page where they will create a username pior to entering the home page. We have implemented an SAT vocabulary set in our hang man game which will allow the user to familiarize themselves with the word stack. After playing a game of hang man, the score of the user will be stored in a leaderboard which they can keep track of. The leaderboards will incorporate a ranking system that lets individuals compete in order to obtain the highest score. The vocabulary words have been strategically selected to engage our users of all age groups
